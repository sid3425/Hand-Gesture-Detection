# Hand Gesture Detection
This program is a Python script that uses your device's webcam to detect hand gestures and show the name of the gesture the user is performing. This is ideal for people with hearing or speech-related issues as they can perform simple hand gestures, which the program can detect and show as text to others, and vice-versa.

### Requirements
Python >=3.11

Pip modules: opencv-python and mediapipe (tensorflow can also be used if you have a dedicated graphics card)
